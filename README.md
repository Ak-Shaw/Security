# Introduction

**Computer security**, **cybersecurity** or **information technology security** (**IT security**) is the protection of [computer systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_system) and [networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network) from the theft of or damage to their [hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_hardware), [software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software), or [electronic data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_(computing)), as well as from the [disruption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack) or [misdirection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botnet) of the services they provide.

### Background

A vulnerability is a weakness in design, implementation, operation, or internal control. An *exploitable* vulnerability is one for which at least one working attack or "[exploit"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploit_(computer_security)) exists. Vulnerabilities can be researched, reverse-engineered, hunted, or exploited using [automated tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_threat) or customised scripts.
